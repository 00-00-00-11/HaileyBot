HaileyBot is a multipurpose bot with many &#34;standard&#34; commands, but what makes her unique are her one-of-a-kind features that you never even knew you needed.

> **DISCLAIMER:** This repository is _not_ intended to be an open-source bot that anybody can host. If you're smart, you can fork this repo and fill in the missing pieces yourself - just remember to follow the terms of the [License](https://github.com/HaileyBot/haileybot/blob/master/LICENSE). Please do not request help with setting up your own hosted version of this bot, as that's a task that should only be taken on by more advanced developers.
